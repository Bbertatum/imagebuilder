- fix extend-root.sh to handle sdx devices as well as mmcblkxpypz devices like used with pmos kernels and data partition on emmc
- change default search engine in firefox to duckduckgo.com instead of google (looks like this is complicated)
- add more doc info to the top level readme (initial setup, scripts in /scripts dir etc.)
- maybe add support for the nvidia jetson nano
- maybe add apple m1 support when asahi linux progressed far enough
- maybe create some useable qemu images too
