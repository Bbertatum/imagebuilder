# extra things to be done to run the imagebuilder on btrfs to avoid useless extra compression

lets assume /dev/xyz to be the disk, which should be mounted to /compile/local to be used as
disk for the imagebuilder framework (in case it is supposed to run in the root fs which
already is btrfs this step is not required):

mkfs -t btrfs -m single -L clocal /dev/xyz

add to /etc/fstab: 
LABEL=clocal /compile/local btrfs defaults,ssd,compress-force=zstd,noatime,nodiratime 0 2

mkdir -p /compile/local
mount /compile/local

the following srteps will be required in any case when the imagebuilder-diskimage dir should
reside on a btrfs filesystem (it should be deleted beforehand in case it already exists):

cd /compile/local/
btrfs subvolume create /compile/local/imagebuilder-diskimage
chattr -R +C /compile/local/imagebuilder-diskimage
btrfs property set /compile/local/imagebuilder-diskimage compression none

# this is required in case the sonaremin image builder is used as well
#btrfs subvolume create /compile/local/sonaremin-diskimage
#chattr -R +C /compile/local/sonaremin-diskimage
#btrfs property set /compile/local/sonaremin-diskimage compression none
