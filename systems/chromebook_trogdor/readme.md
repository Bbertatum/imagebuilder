## special notes

- this is still very much wip, things might work or might not work
- wifi, bt, basic sound seem to be ok, suspend/resume does not seem to work properly yet
- the current sound setup is not complete yet:
  - headphones and headset mic do not work yet, so better use a small usb audio interface for a headset if needed for now
