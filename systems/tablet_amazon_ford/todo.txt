- the system seems to hang on boot from time to time
  - seems to happen more often with bullseye than with focal (but i may be wrong)
- the legacy v3.10 kernel used here seems to be based on v3.10.54, upsteam it went until v3.10.108 (around november 2017)
  - maybe try to patch the legacy up to there step by step
  - maybe even backport later security fixes
- have a look trying to get the legacy wifi driver working somehow (see mediatek section of: https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/WiFi)
  - all experiments so far failed
- it looks like audio is handled via some hal blob on android only as there is no alsa sound device
