- fixed: the system seems to hang on boot from time to time
  - looks like this came from trying to mount /boot which is not needed as its already mounted via initramfs
- the legacy v3.10 kernel used here seems to be based on v3.10.54, upsteam it went until v3.10.108 (around november 2017)
  - maybe try to patch the legacy up to there step by step - some trees which seem to have done this:
    - https://github.com/mt8127/android_kernel_alcatel_ttab
    - https://github.com/ggow/android_kernel_amazon_mt8127-common
  - maybe even backport later security fixes
- it looks like audio is handled via some hal blob on android only as there is no alsa sound device
