- get the display working with mainline (currently it works with a lot of magic patches)
  - v5.13 looks better with fresher and less patches, but there is still room for improvements
- get the usb bandwidth problems working with mainline (the happen mostly with usb audio i think - visible in the kernel logs)
- maybe get more kukui systems supported beyond krane and juniper
- there seems to be some probing dependency for the juniper panel: it only works if not compiled as a module
- some notes about the apu/npu in the mt8183, not sure how relevant or useful they are

  - mt8192 related, but maybe somewhat related: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Mediatek-MT8192-APU-Driver
  - mediatek genio 500 looks very similar to mt8183: https://www.cnx-software.com/2022/05/13/mediatek-genio-1200-premium-aiot-processor-with-4-8-tops-npu/
    - mediatek ai developer site, maybe relevant if the genio 500 maybe is just a relabeled mt8183: https://www.mediatek.com/aiot/home
