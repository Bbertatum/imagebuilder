- investigate if it is maybe possible to use mainline kernels for this kind of booting as well
  - it is possible, tested with v5.15.2, based on cros kernel config
  - wifi and sound are not working yet in this case (maybe it is required to port the iwl7000 driver from cros to mainline?)
  - glamor is working well in xorg with mainline kernel
- make glamor accelerated xorg work
- find proper source urls for the still missing firmware
- make the intel wifi in those chromebooks work reliable
- make the missing parts of sound working
  - headphones and the internal mic do not work yet
