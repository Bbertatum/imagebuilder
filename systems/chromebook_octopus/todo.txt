- make glamor accelerated xorg work for legacy kernel
- add maybe still missing firmware
- make the intel wifi in those chromebooks work reliable (currently it sees the wifi networks, but does not connect properly)
- maybe port the iwl7000 wifi driver from chromeos to mainline to add support for wifi cards which require this driver
- make sound working for the mainline kernel
- make the missing parts of sound working for the legacy kernel
  - headphones and the internal mic do not work yet
