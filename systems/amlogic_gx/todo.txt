- find out why the performance is much lower for s905x3 than for s905x2 (only about 2/3 with vcvrack)
  - tinymembench shows a very small l1 cache for the s905x3
  - surprisingly quite a few perf counters seem to be missing on the s905x3 which are there on all other amlogic socs
- add support (i.e. u-boot, maybe patches and/or ucm files) for s922x (odroid n2, n2+, khadas vim3 and s922x tv boxes), so far only s905, s905x, s905w, s912, s905x2 and s905x3 have been tested
