- cleanup the defconfig based kernel (keep only what is really needed for gru)
- rework sound/ucm to maybe support headphones and headset mic too - they are disabled for now
  - it looks like the headphone/headset audio setup is somewhat special (looking at a name like wacky_spi_audio in the dts) and using and own rt5514 codec
- maybe it is somehow possible to get the penguins early at boot onto the screen? :)
