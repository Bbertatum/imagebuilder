- create a defconfig based kernel more optimized for this chromebook
- try to get suspend/resume working, s2idle and deep suspend do not seem to work right now
- rework sound/ucm to maybe support headphones and headset mic too - they are disabled for now
  - it looks like the headphone/headset audio setup is somewhat special (looking at a name like wacky_spi_audio in the dts) and using and own rt5514 codec
