## special notes

- still very much work in progress, please do not use it yet
- wifi, bt, basic sound seem to be ok, suspend/resume and earlier display/drm init will need some work
- the current sound setup is not complete yet:
  - headphones and headset mic do not work yet, so better use a small usb audio interface for a headset if needed for now
- more info coming soon
