- get console support working reliably for v5.10+
  - it works quite reliable for v5.4
  - it works sometimes for v5.10
  - it does not work anymore for v5.12
  - without CONFIG_FBDEV_EMULATION and tegra, kms helper and nouveau buils as modules at least xorg starts reliable for v5.12 (no console or vt's)
  - seems to be related to drm initialization order
    - working:
      ```
      [drm] Initialized tegra 0.0.0 20120330 for drm on minor 0
      drm drm: [drm] fb0: tegradrmfb frame buffer device
      ```
    - not working:
      ```
      drm drm: [drm] fb0: tegradrmfb frame buffer device
      [drm] Initialized tegra 0.0.0 20120330 for drm on minor 0
      ```
    - next would be to find a way to force proper order
- get thermal throttling (soctherm) working
  - currently cpu speed is limited in rc.local to 1.7ghz to avoid shutdown due to overheating
  - a new patch to usethe regular kernel cpu freq throttling seems to work quite well
- find a way to reenable the display after resume without the current hack
- maybe get some proper kind of suspend working
  - the current s2idle mode does not really save much energy (the battery will just last slightly longer than with normal use)
  - the lowest lp0 suspend mode does not seem to besupported by mainline and would require some extra firmware (see chromeos kernel - maybe for inspiration)
  - someone from archlinux arm got at least lp1 suspend mode working, but i was not able to reproduce this (i was unable to wake it up again after suspend) - see: https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=12185&sid=054215884699c2b79e457eadb8599012&start=230#p64180

- get ucm and sound working properly
  - currently ucm is initializing the mixer settings properly, but pulseaudio cannot deal properly with the resulting ucm setup
  - there is a hack in place so that there isat least some working pulseaudio output
- get u-boot working properly, i.e. one u-boot working for the 2gb/hd and 4gb/full hd model and properly working display all the time
