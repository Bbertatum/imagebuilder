- find a way to reenable the display after resume without the current hack
- maybe get some proper kind of suspend working
- get u-boot working properly, i.e. one u-boot working for the 2gb/hd and 4gb/full hd model and properly working display all the time
- it looks like there is a regression in mesa when trying to use the nouveau driver: mesa-21.0.1 works, mesa-21.1.0 does not longer work
  - a test with v5.18.0 and mesa v22.1.0 resulted in the following error when trying to run glxgears with a proper nouveau and newer xorg setup: "... src/gallium/frontends/dri/dri2.c:705: dri2_allocate_textures: Assertion `*zsbuf' failed."
