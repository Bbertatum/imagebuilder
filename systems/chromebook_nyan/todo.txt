- get console support working reliably for v5.10+
  - it works quite reliable for v5.4
  - it works sometimes for v5.10
  - it does not work anymore for v5.12
  - without CONFIG_FBDEV_EMULATION and tegra, kms helper and nouveau buils as modules at least xorg starts reliable for v5.12 (no console or vt's)
  - seems to be related to drm initialization order
    - working:
      ```
      [drm] Initialized tegra 0.0.0 20120330 for drm on minor 0
      drm drm: [drm] fb0: tegradrmfb frame buffer device
      ```
    - not working:
      ```
      drm drm: [drm] fb0: tegradrmfb frame buffer device
      [drm] Initialized tegra 0.0.0 20120330 for drm on minor 0
      ```
    - next would be to find a way to force proper order
- get thermal throttling (soctherm) working
  - currently cpu speed is limited in rc.local to 1.7ghz to avoid shutdown due to overheating
- find a way to reenable the display after resume without the current hack
