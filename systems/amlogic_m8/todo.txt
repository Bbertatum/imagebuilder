- fix gigabit ethernet on the systems which have such an eth port
- some systems (at least meson8-mxiii) seem to loose the sd card access after a
  reboot and thus will not boot from it in some setups (i think i also saw it
  working somehow a few times before)
- add odroid c1 u-boot bootblocks and boot scripts to the image, so that it at
  least has the chance to work on that system too
