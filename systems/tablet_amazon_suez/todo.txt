- the fbconsole driver seems to be broken
  - seems to basically work (one can switch to it, login blindly on a vt etc.), but all is black on black :)
  - xorg seems to somehow be able to hanlde it
  - worst case maybe just disable the fbconsole driver?
- from time to time an info is printed about hanging kernel threads
  - should be checked in detail
- there is quite good support for the mt8173 soc in mainline for the elm/hana chromebooks
  - maybe it is possible to get mainline working for suez as well
  - a dtb would have to be constructed
  - hopefully enough information can be gathered from the legacy sources
  - hopefully the mainline drivers cover the basic required areas (panel, backlight, usb, mmc, ...)
  - a look at the mainling effort for the mt8163 soc might help (https://github.com/mt8163-mainline/linux)
- there are kernel drivers available for the powervr blob for both v3.18 and near mainline (v5.10 i think) in the chromeos repos
  - maybe it is possible to get them to work together with the (32bit) blob files from chromeos in either legacy or mainline?
  - i guess the only possible way would be via pbuffer (LIBGL_FB=3) mode of gl4es
  - some maybe interesting links:

    - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/master/media-libs/arc-mesa-img/files/
    - both via: https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Nokia_N900_(nokia-n900)
    - see also: https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests/1868
  - for 64bit support: maybe those blob files are worth a look? - https://git.ti.com/git/graphics/ti-img-rogue-umlibs.git
- have a look trying to get the legacy wifi driver working somehow (see mediatek section of: https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/WiFi)
  - no experiments done so far
- audio looks promising
  - there is an mtk alsa audio device in linux and a mixer
  - maybe only a proper ucm file is required? (see: https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Alsa_UCM)
