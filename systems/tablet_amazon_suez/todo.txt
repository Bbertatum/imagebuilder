- the fbconsole driver seems to be broken
  - seems to basically work (one can switch to it, login blindly on a vt etc.), but all is black on black :)
  - xorg seems to somehow be able to hanlde it
  - worst case maybe just disable the fbconsole driver?
- from time to time an info is printed about hanging kernel threads
  - should be checked in detail
- the legacy v3.18 kernel used here seems to be based on v3.18.19, upsteam it went until v3.18.140 (around may 2019)
  - maybe try to patch the legacy up to there step by step - an example tree which seems to have done this:
    - https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+log/refs/heads/android-3.18/Makefile
  - maybe even backport later security fixes
- there is quite good support for the mt8173 soc in mainline for the elm/hana chromebooks
  - maybe it is possible to get mainline working for suez as well
  - a dtb would have to be constructed
  - hopefully enough information can be gathered from the legacy sources
  - hopefully the mainline drivers cover the basic required areas (panel, backlight, usb, mmc, ...)
  - a look at the mainling effort for the mt8163 soc might help (https://github.com/mt8163-mainline/linux)
  - it is close to impossible to get it mainlined as the amazon tablets use mt-boot as cpu enable method and mainline only accepts psci or spin-table (i got this info from the maintainer of the mt8163 mainline tree)
- there are kernel drivers available for the powervr blob for both v3.18 and near mainline (v5.10 i think) in the chromeos repos
  - maybe it is possible to get them to work together with the (32bit) blob files from chromeos in either legacy or mainline?
  - i guess the only possible way would be via pbuffer (LIBGL_FB=3) mode of gl4es
  - some maybe interesting links:
    - https://github.com/xc-racer99/mesa-pvr/
    - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/master/media-libs/arc-mesa-img/files/
    - both via: https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Nokia_N900_(nokia-n900)
    - see also: https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests/1868
  - for 64bit support: maybe those blob files are worth a look? - https://git.ti.com/git/graphics/ti-img-rogue-umlibs.git
    - looks like this one is for another powervr version
- have a look trying to get the legacy wifi driver working somehow (see mediatek section of: https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/WiFi)
  - all experiments so far failed
- maybe somehow get the alsa audio device to cooperate better with pulseaudio (i.e. not having to use device=sysdefault in the pulseaudio config)
  - besides that it might be required to enable the output once by hand before it will work even in alsa mode via "alsaucm -c mtk-snd-card -i" and then entering "set _verb Hifi" and "set _enadev Speaker" - it should remember it afterwards
